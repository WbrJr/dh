# dh
This is my second version of my self made smart home. The fist version was completely developed on the raspberry pi 3 and esp8266 dev boards. I made some interesting choices, so creating a second version is the only logical step to continue this project.
 
 My next goals are:
  - creating a basic but modular firmware for the dh_mb
  - creating a second version of the smart home server (propably with node.js, not apache2. but I have to read into that a lot more)
    - the backend part is ok for now i think, but I want to work on the frontend more and get into typescript and javascript (I used a lot of php for my first version :( I know, I am sorry)

All this will take very long i suppose, because I can not work on this full time. And I am still studying electrical engineering and information technology, so I am by no means experienced. This is a big project for me, but I had so much fun with the first version and want to bring this to the next step.

I want to invite you to contribute to this project if you are interested. I appreciate any help!

So this is my hardware folder. You can find here all files you need to recreate this PCB (Gerber files, BOM, Pnp file) or edit the existing pcb (EasyEda)

For future revisions I want to switch to KiCad, but I wanted to use an easyer eda for my first pcb. It was hard and took long enough, but I hope I got it now.
